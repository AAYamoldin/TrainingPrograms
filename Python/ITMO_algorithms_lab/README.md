* Task 1. Experimental time complexity analysis
* Task 2. Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Direct methods
* Task 3. Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. First- and secondorder methods
* Task 4. Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Stochastic and metaheuristic algorithms
* Task 5. Algorithms on graphs. Introduction to graphs and basic algorithms on graphs
* Task 6. Algorithms on graphs. Path search algorithms on weighted graphs
* Task 7. Algorithms on graphs. Tools for network analysis
* Task 8 (Extended). Practical analysis of advanced algorithms. Were chosen Strassenâ€™s algorithm for matrix multiplication and modified Vinograd-Strassen Algorithm. Results of both algorithms were compared.
